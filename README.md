# Glossary_En_Ge

Here is a short script from 2015. 
I had two files, in English and German. 
The result suppose to be a third file with the combined two. 

To use the script put all the files into one folder, and run the python file. The two source suppose to be named en.txt and ge.txt. 
If you forgot the current working directory (in python): 
import os
os.getcwd()

**Example:**  

**en.txt:** 

dragon 

buda

plato 


**de.txt:** 

fly

pest

aristotle


**glossary.txt:**
